# Variables, if - else , while :bar_chart:
In this section, I learnt how `variables` are used to store the value of an object of any data type be it an `int`, a `char` or a `float` <br>To spice up a program, you can control the flow by using conditional statements and loops <br> The `if - else` statement in C evaluates an expression and will or will not execute the statement(s) depending on the evaluation <br> A `while` loop will iterate if a condition is `true` 

## Tasks :page_facing_up:
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/mburuxx/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative"> 0 - positive-or-negative </a> - a C program that prints a number with the following conditions: if the number is <code>greater than</code> 0 is positive; if the number is <code>0</code> is zero; if the number is <code>less than</code> 0 is negative</li>
</ul>
